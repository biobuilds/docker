# `conda build` creates build environments in "$CONDA_BLD_PATH", which is often
# in the "/src" volume mounted from the host. Since cross-device hard links are
# not possible, conda's default behavior is to symlink when installing packages
# in such environments. However, symlinks break (among other things) RPATH
# determinations, which in turn, can cause things like `gcc` to fail horribly.
# To work around this, we need to tell conda to always copy files rather than
# symlink, even though copying is a fairly expensive (i.e., slow) operation.
